# Challenge 03 - Use Azure Solutions to run your container

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-03.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-05.md)

## Open Assignment

Now that your docker image is stored in your Azure Container Registry, the real fun part begins. Its all fun & games to run the container locally within your Docker Desktop but now the real challenge begins.
It's up to you to make this container image run in as many Azure solutions as possible. Think AKS, AppService, Fabric and the list goes on.....

How many Azure Container Solutions can you deploy **and** have the container running in in the time you have left?

## Success Criteria

1. For each working Azure container solution running the acr-helloworld there will be point rewarded by the jury
2. Extra points if you create a Azure container solution that updates dynamically. This means that solution automatically deploys a new version of the container once you update the image in the ACR. We need working proof of this update/deploy mechanism.
