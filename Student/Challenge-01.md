[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-00.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-02.md)

## hello-world Overview

In today's hackathon, you will be using an application called _hello-world_, which is a very simple website application. The application consists of one component: a sample website which is written using ASP.NET.

## Pull the hello-world application to your local system and build a container image using Docker

The **acr-helloworld** application is made available on GitHub by Microsoft. You can find it here: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/acr-helloworld

Clone the application to your local PC, build the container from the docker file and run it locally to see if it works.

## Success Criteria

1. You have the **hello-world** image added to your local Docker repository
2. You have the **hello-world** application running locally and validated that there is a running website at http://localhost:8080
