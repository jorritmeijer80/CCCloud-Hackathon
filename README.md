# What The Hack - Azure Container Solutions in the mix

## Introduction

Welcome to all of you, dear hackathon attendees. Welcome, to the first 'Competence Center Cloud' Hackathon!
Yes, we know, a hackathon is supposed to run 24 to 48 hours, but this is our short version of such an event. In fact you will have exactly 90 minutes to build and/or implement a number of solutions to deal with our challenge. The best part? You will be working side by side with colleagues you already know but also with collegeaus you might no know just yet. Our pro-tip: work togheter to learn and get most of the work done within 90 minutes.

This intro level hack will help you get hands-on experience with Docker containers and possible container solutions on Microsoft Azure.
After this hack, you will have a basic understanding of Docker Containers, Azure Container Registry and Azure Container solutions.

## Learning Objectives

You will learn about Docker Containers, how to run them locally, how to build them, tag them and upload them to the native container registry in Azure: Azure Container Registry.
During the open challenge you will try and figure out which solution Azure has to offer to run containers and deploy as many of them as you can.

## Challenges

- Challenge 00: **[Prerequisites - Ready, Set, GO!](Student/Challenge-00.md)**
	 - Prepare your workstation to work with Azure, Docker containers, and AKS
- Challenge 01: **[Got Containers?](Student/Challenge-01.md)**
	 - Package the "acr-helloworld" app into a Docker container and run it locally.
- Challenge 02: **[The Azure Container Registry](Student/Challenge-02.md)**
	 - Deploy an Azure Container Registry, secure it and get some basic info out of it.
- Challenge 03: **[Tinker with the docker image & Uploading it to your ACR](Student/Challenge-03.md)**
	 - Update your container image and upload it to your ACR
- Challenge 04: **[Use Azure Solutions to run your container](Student/Challenge-04.md)**
	 - How many Azure container solutions can you find to host your container?
